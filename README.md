# :wave: Hello logsight.ai from GitHub Actions

**Continuous Verification and Testing** are important phases of software delivery.
This repo described how [logsight.ai](https://logsight.ai) can be used to add Quality Gates to a CI/CD pipeline build with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
 
We use the [Stage Verifier](https://docs.logsight.ai/#/stage_verification/overview) service from [logsight.ai](https://logsight.ai) since it enables to analyze and compare log files generated by differente versions of an application.


## Use Case

+ You are collaborating on changes to a repository using your own branch
+ You create a pull request to propose a new feature
+ Before merging the changes, the CI/CD triggers a continuous verification gate of 

<div align=center><img src="assets/use_case.png" alt="drawing" style="width:40%;"/></div>

+ [Logsight](https://logsight.ai) [Stage Verifier](https://docs.logsight.ai/#/stage_verification/overview) analyzes the logs generated by the two applications / branches
+ The deployment risk score returned is 78%
+ Since the risk is high, the merge is automatically cancelled and a [GitHub Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues) is raised

1. **Fork** the repository 
2. Go to **Pull Requests** and click on **New pull request**
3. Set `compare` to `candidate` and **Create pull request**.
5. The **quality check will run**.
6. If the check is failing, it will create an issue report that specifies the **deployment risk**. You can check the report in the [**Issues**](https://github.com/aiops/hello-logsight/issues).

## Steps
1. **Fork** the repository 
<div align=center><img src="assets/fork.png" alt="drawing" style="width:80%;"/> </div>

2. Go to **Pull Requests** and click on **New pull request**
3. Set `compare` to `candidate` and **Create pull request**.
<div align=center><img src="assets/pullrq.png" alt="drawing" style="width:80%;"/> </div>

5. The **quality check will run**.
<div align=center><img src="assets/check.png" alt="drawing" style="width:80%;"/> </div>

6. If the check is failing, it will create an issue report that specifies the **deployment risk**. You can check the report in the [**Issues**](https://github.com/aiops/hello-logsight/issues).


## Report in Github

The issue looks similar to:
<div align=center><img src="assets/issue.png" alt="drawing" style="width:80%;"/> </div>


## Report in Logsight.ai

To open the detailed online report, you need to have [logsight.ai](https://demo.logsight.ai/) user account. 
**Login and then click** on the detailed report.

The detailed online report shows the overview and the state analysis as in:
<div align=center><img src="assets/report.png" alt="drawing" style="width:80%;"/> </div>


The hello-logsight example ends here. You can get more in-depth knowledge about the actions and how to use them at the [Docs.](https://docs.logsight.ai/#/monitor_deployments/github_action)
