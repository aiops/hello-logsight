# :wave: Hello logsight.ai from GitHub Actions

**Continuous Verification and Testing** are important phases of software delivery.
This repo described how [logsight.ai](https://logsight.ai) can be used to add Quality Gates to a CI/CD pipeline build with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
 
We use the [Stage Verifier](https://docs.logsight.ai/#/stage_verification/overview) service from [logsight.ai](https://logsight.ai) since it enables to analyze and compare log files generated by differente versions of an application.


## Use Case

+ You are collaborating on changes to a repository using your own branch
+ You create a pull request to propose a new feature
+ Before merging the changes, the CI/CD triggers a continuous verification gate 

<div align=center><img src="assets/use_case.png" alt="drawing" style="width:40%;"/></div>

+ [Logsight](https://logsight.ai) [Stage Verifier](https://docs.logsight.ai/#/stage_verification/overview) analyzes the logs generated by the two applications / branches
+ The deployment risk score is :warning: 78% 
+ Since the risk is high, the merge is automatically cancelled and a [GitHub Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues) is created


## For the impatient

To try the simplicity and transparency of using [Logsight](https://logsight.ai), we recommend you to follow the instructions directly from our [Hello Logsight tutorial](https://docs.logsight.ai/#/integration/github_action)


1. **Fork** the [hello-logsight](https://github.com/aiops/hello-logsight) repository 
<div align=center><img src="assets/fork.png" alt="drawing" style="width:40%;"/> </div>

2. Go to **Pull Requests** and create a **New pull request**
<div align=center><img src="assets/pull_requests.png" alt="drawing" style="width:80%;"/> </div>

3. In the **compare** drop-down list, set `compare: candidate`
<div align=center><img src="assets/pullrq.png" alt="drawing" style="width:80%;"/> </div>

4. **Create pull request**
<div align=center><img src="assets/create_pull_request.png" alt="drawing" style="width:80%;"/> </div>

5. The **continuous verification** gate runs
<div align=center><img src="assets/check.png" alt="drawing" style="width:80%;"/> </div>

6. If the verification fails:bangbang:, a report is created with the **deployment risk** at [**Issues**](https://github.com/aiops/hello-logsight/issues).
<div align=center><img src="assets/issues.png" alt="drawing" style="width:80%;"/> </div>

6. If the verification fails:bangbang:, a report is created with the **deployment risk**.
The report is available under GitHub [**Issues**](https://github.com/aiops/hello-logsight/issues).
<div align=center><img src="assets/issues.png" alt="drawing" style="width:80%;"/> </div>


## Github Report

The following image gives an example of a report created by the CI/CD [Stage Verifier](https://docs.logsight.ai/#/stage_verification/overview) gate:

<div align=center><img src="assets/issue_report.png" alt="drawing" style="width:80%;"/> </div>


## Logsight.ai Report

You can also view a **more detailed** report of the verification using the online service.
You need to have a [logsight.ai](https://demo.logsight.ai/) user account. 

To access the report, select the **Detailed onine report** link shown in the Github Report.
